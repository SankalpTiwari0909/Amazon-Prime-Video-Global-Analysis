🚀 **Amazon Prime Video: Key Insights & Strategic Moves** 🎬📊  

I analyzed **9,651 titles** from Amazon Prime Video, and here’s what stood out—along with strategies for growth! 👇  

📌 **Movies vs. TV Shows**  
✅ **81% Movies | 19% TV Shows** → Prime Video is movie-heavy, unlike Netflix’s TV-first approach.  
💡 **Recommendation:** Invest in **original TV series** to boost long-term engagement and subscriber retention.  

📌 **Top Genres**  
🎭 **Drama & Comedy dominate**, while **Westerns, Music Videos & Romance** are underrepresented.  
💡 **Recommendation:** Expand niche genres like **horror, sci-fi, and regional storytelling** to attract diverse audiences.  

📌 **Content Growth & Ratings**  
📈 **Massive spike in new releases** in recent years.  
👨‍👩‍👧 **Mostly family-friendly** (13+ & ALL ratings), with little R-rated content.  
💡 **Recommendation:** Introduce **more mature, premium content** to compete with HBO & Netflix’s high-quality originals.  

📌 **Global Reach**  
🌍 Strong presence in **North America & Europe**, but **gaps in Africa & the Middle East**.  
💡 **Recommendation:** Invest in **localized content & dubbing** to drive international market penetration.
